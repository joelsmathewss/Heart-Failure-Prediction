# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient health records.  
By leveraging models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forests, we aim to build a reliable system that can assist in early diagnosis.
